# Home Hello

Use my [home]() as yours.

## Run it locally

First [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) extended edition; I prefer the [pre-built binary](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/latest).

Then setup project by running `setup.sh`:

```
bash setup.sh
```

Now you can start the web server which reloads on any change:

```
hugo server
```
